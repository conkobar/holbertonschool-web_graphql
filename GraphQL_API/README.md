 ### <center>Description</center> 
 ##### &emsp; In this project, you will create an application using a query language, designed to make APIs fast, flexible and developer-friendly. In the first part, you will create the back-end part using ExpressJs and set up GraphQl with all the parts (schema, root query and resolve function). In second part, you will connect your back-end to mongoDB and test your queries to GraphQL server using Graphiql. In the last part, you will create the front-end part using ReactJS and the GraphQL Client Apollo.
